# ⚙️ Scalability and Architecture Design

This document explains how the Backend Assignment Project can be scaled and deployed for production-grade performance while keeping maintainability and cost efficiency in mind.

---

## 1. System Architecture Overview

**Current Architecture:**
- Monolithic Express.js backend (suggested)
- MongoDB Atlas for storage
- JWT-based authentication

**Future Scalable Architecture:**
```
Client (React/Next.js)
        ↓
API Gateway / Load Balancer (Nginx / AWS ELB)
        ↓
Authentication Service  →  MongoDB Users Collection
Task Service             →  MongoDB Tasks Collection
Notification Service     →  Redis / Kafka for async events
```

Each service can be containerized and deployed independently, allowing horizontal scaling under load.

## 2. Deployment Strategy

| Component | Deployment Option |
|-----------|------------------|
| Backend API | Render / Railway / AWS EC2 |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas |
| Static Files / Frontend | Netlify / Vercel |
| Containerization | Docker |

**Dockerfile Example:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

## 3. Performance Optimization Techniques

- Use Mongoose indexes for frequent queries
- Implement caching (Redis) for GET requests
- Add pagination for /tasks endpoint
- Serve static assets via CDN

---

## 4. Microservices Transition Plan

1. Split services by domain (Auth, Tasks, Admin)
2. Use a shared JWT verification middleware library
3. Introduce API Gateway for routing and LB
4. Use RabbitMQ / Kafka for async communication
5. Deploy each service independently via Docker/Kubernetes

---

## 5. Security & Reliability

- Manage environment variables securely
- Enforce HTTPS and secure CORS configuration
- Add rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
- Centralized error handling
- Regular DB backups and monitoring

---

## 6. Monitoring & Logging

- Winston / Morgan for structured logs
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- Uptime monitoring with UptimeRobot / Datadog

---

## 7. Future Upgrades

- Add GraphQL for flexible querying
- Redis session store
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Serverless functions for cost efficiency
